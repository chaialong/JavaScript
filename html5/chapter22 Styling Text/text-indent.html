       There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500
       varieties of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of
       apples, oranges, and other well-known fruit, we are faced with
       thousands of choices.
       One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the
       variety available in each country. I live near London, in an area which is
       known for its apples.
