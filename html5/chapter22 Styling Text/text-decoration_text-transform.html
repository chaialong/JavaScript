    There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500
    varieties of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of
    apples, oranges, and other well-known fruit, we are faced with
    thousands of choices.
    One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the
    variety available in each country. I live near London, in an area which is
    known for its apples.
