        There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500 varieties
        of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of apples,
        oranges, and other well-known fruit, we are faced with thousands
        of choices.

        One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the variety available in
        each country. I live near London, in an area which is known for
        its apples.

        When travelling in Asia, I was struck by how many different kinds of
        banana were available - many of which had unique flavours and which
        were only available within a small region.
