    There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500 varieties
    of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of apples, oranges,
    and other well-known fruit, we are faced with thousands of choices.
</p>
<p>
    One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the variety available in
    each country. <span>I live near London</span>, in an area which is known for
    its apples. When travelling in Asia, I was struck by how many different
    kinds of banana were available - many of which had unique flavours and
    which were only avaiable within a small region.
