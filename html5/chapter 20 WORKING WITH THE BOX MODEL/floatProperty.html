    There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500 varieties
    of banana alone. By the time we add the countless types of apples, oranges,
    and other well-known fruit, we are faced with thousands of choices.

    each country. I live near London, in an area which is known for
    its apples.

    kinds of banana were available - many of which had unique flavours and
    which were only available within a small region.
